## Getting Started

First, the bootstrapper must be initialized.

```csharp
RepoDb.MySqlBootstrap.Initialize();
```

**Note:** The call must be done once.

After the bootstrap initialization, any library operation can then be called.

### Query

```csharp
using (var connection = new MySqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var customer = connection.Query<Customer>(c => c.Id == 10045);
}
```

### Insert

```csharp
var customer = new Customer
{
	FirstName = "John",
	LastName = "Doe",
	IsActive = true
};
using (var connection = new MySqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var id = connection.Insert<Customer>(customer);
}
```

### Update

```csharp
using (var connection = new MySqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var customer = connection.Query<Customer>(10045);
	customer.FirstName = "John";
	customer.LastUpdatedUtc = DateTime.UtcNow;
	var affectedRows = connection.Update<Customer>(customer);
}
```

### Delete

```csharp
using (var connection = new MySqlConnection(ConnectionString))
{
	var customer = connection.Query<Customer>(10045);
	var deletedCount = connection.Delete<Customer>(customer);
}
```
