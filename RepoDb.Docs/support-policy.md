# Our Support Policy

RepoDB is primarily maintained by a single entity and this entity is a person and not an organization. Though, the open community can help support the library in an open-source context.

When doing an operational support, we will not enforce any monetray contributions from the other party as all kind of support is always free.

#### Disclaimer

The maintainer has the rights to say NO to any kind of support during the work hours (weekdays) from 7am to 4pm (CET) of the mentioned timezone. However, an open-source community has the rights to support the library (anytime, anywhere).

### Consultancy

In the event of consultancy, as needed by the other party, a schedule can be defined in advance by collaborating directly to the author. You can directly reach the author's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mike_pendon) account and/or send a direct [email](mailto:michael.c.pendon@outlook.com).

### Channels

We strongly recommend to the .NET community to always reach our proper [channels](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB#engagements). Alternatively, directly reach us via the author's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mike_pendon) account.

### Governance

Until the proper governance and entitlement of the library in the legal/trademark (conflict of interests, taxation, etc), the support will remain as it is.
