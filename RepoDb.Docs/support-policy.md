# Our Support Policy

It is important to note, RepoDB is maintained by a single entity and this entity is a person and not an organization.

We will not enforce any monetray contributions from the other party, all support will always be free!

Below are the things to consider.

- The maintainer will do any kind of support on Central European Time (CET) timezone.
- The maintainer will do the inquiry support to the .NET community anytime except for the night time (from 10pm to 5am) of the mentioned timezone.
- The maintainer will do the development, enhancement and the implementation support (in between 5am to 7am and/or 10pm to 12pm) of the mentioned timezone.
- The maintainer has the rights to say NO to any kind of support during the work hours (from 7am to 4pm CET) of the mentioned timezone.

We strongly recommend to the .NET community to always reach our proper [channels](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB#engagements). Alternatively, directly reach us via the author's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mike_pendon) account.

Until the proper governance and entitlement of the library in the legal/trademark (conflict of interests, taxation, etc), the support will remain as it is.
